               <p>The number of web applications being created and used has grown
                  rapidly since the new millenium. And importantly, so has the
                  sheer complexity of them -- specially on the front end. No more
                  static pages, no sir!
               </p>

               <p>
                  You have a ton of sections each interacting with each other and
                  the server and yes, it's as complicated as it sounds and just as
                  hard to pull off. Today, I'd like to talk about a few choice
                  JavaScript frameworks that aim to simplify front-end application
                  development.
